## 🔥 **Refined Frontend Structure**
A clear and modular approach will help in maintaining and extending the platform easily.

```
/frontend
  ├── /src
  │   ├── /components  (Reusable UI components)
  │   ├── /pages       (Main pages of the app)
  │   ├── /layouts     (Page layouts)
  │   ├── /services    (API calls & backend interactions)
  │   ├── /utils       (Utility functions, helper files)
  │   ├── /styles      (Global and component-specific styles)
  │   ├── App.js       (Main entry point)
  │   ├── index.js     (Root React entry file)
  ├── /public
  ├── package.json
  ├── tailwind.config.js (For TailwindCSS if used)
  ├── postcss.config.js (For CSS optimizations)
```

## 📌 **Pages and Features**
Here’s how each route will be structured with clear functionalities:

### **🟢 `/dashboard` (Main Overview Page)**
- **Model Cards/Grid View:** Show all available LLMs with **performance metrics, response quality, and efficiency details**.
- **Visualizations Based on Chat History & Accuracy:**
  - 🌊 **Comparative accuracy** across different models.
  - 📈 **Performance over time** (based on queries submitted).
  - 🎯 **Evaluation metrics:** 
    - Accuracy
    - Relevance
    - Fluency
    - Bias & Safety
    - Domain-specific benchmarks.
  - 🏆 **Suitability of models** based on:
    - Accuracy
    - Adaptability to domains
    - Cost-effectiveness.
- **Search & Filters:** 
  - **Filter by model, category (e.g., legal, medical, coding), date, accuracy range, fluency, etc.**
  - **Quick search box to find past responses.**

---

### **🟡 `/models` (Individual Model Insights)**
- **Deep dive into a particular model's performance.**
- **Charts/Graphs Comparing Responses:** 
  - Accuracy over different categories.
  - Bias & Safety.
  - Performance in domain-specific cases.
- **History of Queries for That Model:** 
  - Query-wise evaluation stored.
  - Easy navigation to previous responses.
- **Adaptability Score for Real-World Use Cases.**

---

### **🟠 `/chats` (Chat History & Saved Conversations)**
- **🔄 Sidebar with Chat Sessions:**  
  - Each row represents a past chat session.  
  - Clicking opens full chat history with timestamps.
- **🤖 User-friendly UI like ChatGPT**
  - Messages styled distinctly for **User vs. LLM**.
  - Color-coded responses.
  - Show **metadata** (model used, date, response time, etc.).
- **🔍 Filter by**
  - Model used
  - Date range
  - Domain-specific benchmarks

---

## ✨ **Core Features**
### ✅ **Prompt Box**
- **Text Input** for manual queries.
- **File Input** (Upload JSON, TXT, PDF, or structured data).
- **Model Selection Dropdown** (Choose from available models).
- **(Optional) Voice Input Support** (Convert to text before processing).
- **Button to Query the Model**.

---

### ✅ **Querying Approaches**
#### 🔹 **Simple Querying**
1. Input text or attach a file.
2. Choose the LLM model.
3. Model generates response.
4. Response saved & displayed.
5. Compare with **actual answer** (if available).

#### 🔹 **API-Based Querying (Batch Processing)**
1. Upload a JSON file.
2. Backend extracts **all questions**.
3. Pass each question to the **selected model**.
4. Model generates responses **one-by-one or in one-go**.
5. Save:
   - **Questions**
   - **Model Responses**
   - **Actual Answers**
6. Visualization:
   - Compare responses with actual answers.

💚 **Ultimate Outcome:**  
- Each query-response pair is stored **with evaluation scores.**
- Can be used later for **charts & insights.**

---

## 🔥 **Professional & Modern Visualizations**
Using **Chart.js** or **ECharts**, we can implement:
1. **🌊 Bar Charts**
   - Accuracy comparison of models.
   - Domain-wise performance evaluation.
   
2. **📈 Line Charts**
   - Model response accuracy over time.
   - Improvement in model responses.

3. **📏 Radar Charts**
   - **Suitability Score:** Evaluate models based on **accuracy, fluency, adaptability, cost**.

4. **🧬 Heatmaps**
   - Model performance based on **query type (legal, medical, coding, etc.).**
   
5. **📊 Data Tables**
   - All chats & queries **stored with metadata**.

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
1. **Choose UI Framework**
   - **TailwindCSS (recommended for modern UI).**
   - Material UI or Chakra UI for pre-built components.

2. **Implement Core Features**
   - Build prompt box with **text/file input**.
   - Set up API-based querying for **batch processing**.

3. **Integrate Charts & Tables**
   - Use Chart.js or ECharts for **interactive insights**.

4. **Setup History Management**
   - Store all responses properly for later analysis.

---

### 📣 **Your Thoughts?**
- Do you want **real-time querying or async processing?**
- Should there be **user accounts** to save chats per user?
- Any other **features** you want to add?

Let me know, and I can help with the **frontend UI components & API structure!** 🚀🔥


















# LLM Models Accuracy Testing Application
==========================================

# So I have structured the frontend as:
---------------------------------------

## `/dashboard`

### all models (little detials about them)

		-> Visulizations based on the chats/responses accuracy with actual answers
			-> evaluation matrix: accuracy, relevance, fluency, bias & safety, domain specific benchmarks.. etc
		-> Visualizations based on the basic domain specific benchmarks
		-> Suitability or Adaptability of the model based on accuracy, domain specific benchmarks, and costs
		-> All chats(new) history of the particular model

### search
		-> filters based on models, specific domains/categories, basic benchmarks, etc)


## `/models`

		-> Visulizations based on the chats/responses accuracy with actual answers
		-> Visualizations based on the basic domain specific benchmarks
			-> evaluation matrix: accuracy, relevance, fluency, bias & safety, domain specific benchmarks.. etc
		-> Suitability or Adaptability of the model based on accuracy, domain specific benchmarks, and costs
		-> All chats(new) history of the particular model


## `/chats(new)`

		-> just like chatgpt webpage chat history rendering. showing every new chats started in rows when a user clicks and opens it, it will then show all the history and chats between user and llm.
		-> domain specific catgories and dates(days)


### `NOTE: For visualizations: we can use good and professional modern charts, graphs, pies, tables, or any thing better u can suggest with understandable annotations and brief description.`


# Features
----------

## `Prompt box`: text input, file input, model choice, and if possible voice input.

### -> Querying: Simple and API based( one-by-one or in one go )

	-> Simple: input the specific prompt, insert/attach the file, llm generates the response, save the response.
		`ultimate result: get question, response and actual answer for comparision.`

	-> API based: input the file( in my case for now I need json ), then here I must create an api for extracting the questions from json/any file and give that as text input to selected model, and then the model will generate the response. But this api call can be one-by-one (means extract one question->input it to model->model generates response->save response to particular question) or in one-go (means extract all questions in one go-> input it to model as structured text-> response generated->save it..) and at the end all the response must me saved to their particular questions.
		`ultimate result: get all questions, all response corresponding to questions, all actual answers for comparision.`

### `NOTE: Here all the chats must be saved so that can be rendered on chats/history...`

# This is full structure of the frontend or u can say the application I am building.
